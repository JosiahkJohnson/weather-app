# weather-app
This weather app uses Opendweathermap's api to display weather for any city you enter.

# Search box and recent searches
On the left side of the page there is a search box and a recent searches list.
When you enter a valid city name, it will search the database at openweathermap's api for information on the weather situation for that city.

Clicking on a recent searched city's name will render said cities information back onto the screen. No need to search for the city again. This box will hold onto your last 10 searches.
